## 🚀 Projects

### 🩺 Heart Disease Detection

**Objective:**  
Predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using clinical and demographic features.

**Key Steps:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Performance evaluation with metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

**Outcome:**  
A trained classifier to assist in early detection of heart disease risk.

### 💳 Credit Worthiness Prediction

**Objective:**  
Classify customers as creditworthy or not based on financial and demographic information.

**Key Steps:**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Handling class imbalance
- Feature engineering
- Model training (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluation using metrics such as ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score

**Outcome:**  
A machine learning model to help financial institutions assess credit risk.
